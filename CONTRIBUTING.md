# Contributing to PuppetMaster

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PuppetMaster! We welcome contributions from the community to help make this project better.

## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute:

*   **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please open an issue on GitHub. Include detailed steps to reproduce the bug, the expected behavior, and the actual behavior. Check existing issues first to see if the bug has already been reported.
*   **Suggesting Enhancements:** Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one? Open an issue describing your suggestion. Provide as much detail as possible about the use case and potential implementation.
*   **Submitting Pull Requests:** If you want to contribute code, please follow the steps below.

## Pull Request Process

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the PuppetMaster repository.
2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your fork to your local machine (`git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PuppetMaster.git`).
3.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `bugfix/issue-description`). Use a descriptive branch name.
4.  **Set Up Development Environment:** Follow the installation instructions in the main `README.md` to set up your local development environment.
5.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your feature or bug fix. Ensure your code adheres to the project's style guidelines (consider adding a linter like ESLint if not already present).
6.  **Test Your Changes:** Add a simple test script as necessary to cover your changes. Ensure all tests pass.
7.  **Commit Your Changes:** Write clear and concise commit messages. Reference any relevant issue numbers (e.g., `feat: Add support for XYZ (#123)`).
8.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your changes to your fork on GitHub (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
9.  **Open a Pull Request:** Go to the original PuppetMaster repository and open a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch.
    *   Provide a clear title and description for your pull request.
    *   Explain the problem your PR solves and the changes you made.
    *   Link to any relevant issues.
10. **Address Feedback:** Respond to any feedback or questions during the code review process. Make necessary changes by pushing additional commits to your branch.

## Code Style

Please try to follow the existing code style. If linters (like ESLint for JavaScript or Flake8/Black for Python) are configured, ensure your code passes the lint checks.

## Testing

Include unit tests or integration test scripts for new features or bug fixes where applicable. Ensure existing tests continue to pass after your changes.
